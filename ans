Sure, I can help you with these Python programs. Here are the solutions to your questions:

**1. Check if a number is a Disarium Number:**

A Disarium number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to their respective positions.

```python
def is_disarium_number(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    length = len(num_str)
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) ** (i + 1) for i, digit in enumerate(num_str))
    return n == digit_sum

# Test the function
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_disarium_number(number):
    print(f"{number} is a Disarium number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a Disarium number.")
```

**2. Print all Disarium numbers between 1 and 100:**

```python
def is_disarium_number(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    length = len(num_str)
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) ** (i + 1) for i, digit in enumerate(num_str))
    return n == digit_sum

disarium_numbers = [n for n in range(1, 101) if is_disarium_number(n)]
print("Disarium numbers between 1 and 100:", disarium_numbers)
```

**3. Check if a number is a Happy Number:**

A Happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit in the number.

```python
def is_happy_number(n):
    seen = set()
    while n != 1 and n not in seen:
        seen.add(n)
        n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))
    return n == 1

# Test the function
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_happy_number(number):
    print(f"{number} is a Happy number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a Happy number.")
```

**4. Print all Happy numbers between 1 and 100:**

```python
def is_happy_number(n):
    seen = set()
    while n != 1 and n not in seen:
        seen.add(n)
        n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))
    return n == 1

happy_numbers = [n for n in range(1, 101) if is_happy_number(n)]
print("Happy numbers between 1 and 100:", happy_numbers)
```

**5. Check if a number is a Harshad Number:**

A Harshad number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

```python
def is_harshad_number(n):
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    return n % digit_sum == 0

# Test the function
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_harshad_number(number):
    print(f"{number} is a Harshad number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a Harshad number.")
```

**6. Print all Pronic numbers between 1 and 100:**

A pronic number, also known as a rectangular number, is the product of two consecutive integers.

```python
def is_pronic_number(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if i * (i + 1) == n:
            return True
    return False

pronic_numbers = [n for n in range(1, 101) if is_pronic_number(n)]
print("Pronic numbers between 1 and 100:", pronic_numbers)
```

These Python programs should help you with the tasks you mentioned. Just copy and paste the code into your Python environment and run it.
